My master thesis was on the reconstruction and investigation of paleoclimate dynamics of the Pantanal region in Mid-West Brazil during the Holocene, using stalagmite proxy records and climate model data.

I analysed existing ECHAM5-wiso or COSMOS isotope-enabled, transient atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) data. Specifically focusing on the variables: stable isotope, temperature and precipitation. Because the model simulations were missing some monthly data (7 months), I had to split the time range into 2 parts and combine the second set of dates with the first so that the paleoclimate seasonal maps could be plotted correctly.

I also analysed stalagmite proxy data (DBE1) for the reconstruction of the Holocene paleoclimate in the Pantanal.
