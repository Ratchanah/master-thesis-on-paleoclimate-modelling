My master thesis was on the reconstruction and investigation of paleoclimate dynamics of the Pantanal region in Mid-West Brazil during the Holocene, using stalagmite proxy records and climate model data.

I analysed existing COSMOS transient GCM climate model data. Specifically focusing on the variables: stable isotope, temperature and precipitation. 

I also analysed stalagmite proxy data for the reconstruction of the Holocene paleoclimate in the Pantanal.
