My master thesis was on the reconstruction and investigation of paleoclimate dynamics of the Pantanal region in Mid-West Brazil during the Holocene, using stalagmite proxy records and climate model data.

I analysed existing COSMOS transient atmospheric general circulation climate model data. Specifically focusing on the variables: stable isotope, temperature and precipitation. Because the model simulations were missing some monthly data (7 months), I had to split the time range into 2 parts and combine the second set of dates with the first so that the paleoclimate seasonal maps could be plotted correctly.

I also analysed stalagmite proxy data for the reconstruction of the Holocene paleoclimate in the Pantanal.
